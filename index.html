    <h1>Looking Glass Visuals Photography</h1>
      <p><em>Published photographer, specializing in portrait, fashion, and boudoir photography.</em></p>
      <p>As a professional photographer, I aim to capture important moments and memories. Whether I'm shooting lifestyle, portraits, boudoir, real estate, or events, I always aim to create art by telling a story or conveying strong emotion through my photos. Before I became a photographer, I actually began my career as a model. As such, I am able to assist with posing and styling for all my portrait, lifestyle, and studio clients. Modeling gave me a sense of empowerment and confidence that I had never felt before in my life. Eventually I started itching to try out the other end of the lens in the hopes of giving others a similar positive and empowering experience. For all my event clients, I take pride in capturing the beautiful candid moments that make the event so special and memorable. Whether you are looking for a head shot for your linkedin profile, a sexy boudoir photo album to surprise your significant other, photos to market the house you'd like to sell, or wedding photos to remember your special day, I will ensure you receive high quality images you can proudly display. </p>
